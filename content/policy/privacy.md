# Rust Privacy Notice
Version 1.1, dated 2020-09-15

The Rust Project oversees a number of projects, including the Rust website, crates.io, and docs.rs. This privacy notice explains what we do with personal information.

## rust-lang.org
The Rust website at rust-lang.org is a project of the Core team and the Community team.

Visitor logs:

    When you visit rust-lang.org, we receive your IP address as part of our standard server logs. We store these logs for 1 year.

## crates.io
Crates.io is managed by members of the Crates.io and Rust core teams.

Logging in with GitHub:

    Crates.io requires users to have a GitHub account in order to log in and use the service. When you log in to Crates.io using a GitHub account, we receive your GitHub username and avatar. If you share a display name or public email address in your GitHub public profile, we also receive that information.

Email addresses:

    You must have a verified email address to publish a crate. We receive any public email address associated with your GitHub account. You can also choose to submit a different address to associate with your Crates.io activity. We will only use your email address to contact you about your account.

Visitor logs:

    When you visit Crates.io, we receive your IP address and user-agent header as part of our standard server logs. We store these logs for 1 year.

Information uploaded to crates:

    All crates on Crates.io are public, including the list of crate owners’ user names and the crate upload date. Anyone may view or download a crate’s contents. Because of the public nature of Crates.io, any personal data you might include in a Cargo.toml file uploaded to a crate will be publicly available. For example, if an email address is in the `authors` field in the Cargo.toml file, that email address will also be public.

    Due to its public nature, be aware if you include any private information in a crate, that information may be indexed by search engines or used by third parties. Sensitive information should not be included in a crate file.

Publication of site-related data:

    Crates.io uses the Google Visualization API to create graphs for each crate showing downloads over the last 90 days. Those graphs can be seen at the bottom of each crate’s page.

Error monitoring:

    Crates.io uses Sentry, an error monitoring service, to help the Rust team discover and fix the performance of the code. When there is an error, Sentry receives basic information about how you interacted with the website and the actions that led to the error. Additionally, your IP address may be disclosed to Sentry as part of the error reporting process but we’ve configured Sentry to delete it as soon as it’s received. Read Sentry’s Privacy Policy here.

## docs.rs
Docs.rs is managed by the members of the docs.rs team and Rust core team.

Visitor logs:

    When you visit docs.rs, we receive your IP address and user-agent header as part of our standard server logs. We store these logs for 1 year.

## Forums
The Rust Community team administers the Users Forum and the Internals Forum. Posts on these forums are public. If you sign up to participate in these forums, we collect your email address and name. As administrators of the forum, we have access to usage information regarding your interactions with it, such as posts published and read, and time spent on the site.

## Third-party Services
The Users Forum and Internals Forum on rust-lang.org are hosted by Discourse and use its open source discussion platform. Discourse’s privacy policy is available here.

We use Mailgun to send email. Mailgun’s privacy policy is available here.

GitHub login is used for authentication in Crates.io and (optionally) in the forums. GitHub’s Privacy Statement can be found here.

Some Rust team members use the Zulip and Discord platforms for community collaboration. Zulip’s privacy notice is available here. Discord’s privacy notice is available here.
